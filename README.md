# ngl – Not Gonna Lie! 📸✨

> *"A fictional world more representative of reality than dull reality itself."*

**ngl** (Not Gonna Lie) is a creative photo-based storytelling tool that gives you the freedom to reassemble your visual memories into compelling narratives. Born from MFA Photography research exploring how AI and computational photography can reveal deeper truths about our experiences, ngl lets you construct stories that feel more authentic than straightforward documentation.

## 🌟 What is ngl?

Think of ngl as a creative partner for visual storytelling. Upload your photos, and the app uses AI to identify the most significant elements within them. Then, like assembling a collage, you can layer these elements to create new compositions that capture the emotional truth of your experiences—even if they never existed quite this way in reality.

This approach mirrors how human memory actually works: fragmented, layered, and emotionally weighted rather than photographically accurate.

### The Philosophy

As explored in the [conceptual essays](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/vvSDtHl3igv36KMY), ngl challenges traditional documentary photography by:

- **Embracing computational creativity** – Using AI not just for reproduction, but as a co-creator in the artistic process
- **Prioritizing emotional truth** – Assembling scenes that feel more representative of lived experience than literal documentation
- **Deconstructing and reconstructing** – Breaking images into elements and reassembling them with intention, similar to how memory fragments blend together

The work builds on research into "softimages"—images that exist as software programs, infinitely adaptable and merged with computational processes, representing a fundamentally different kind of photograph for our digital age.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- **Node.js** installed on your computer ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- A **Gemini API key** from Google ([Get one free](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thecont1/ngl-storyteller.git
   cd ngl-storyteller
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your API key**
   - Create a file called `.env.local` in the project folder
   - Add this line: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
   - Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Upload your photos** – Select images that tell parts of your story
2. **Let AI analyze** – The app identifies significant elements in each image
3. **Compose your narrative** – Layer and arrange extracted elements to build your story
4. **Export and share** – Save your creation as a moving still or interactive presentation

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Personal storytelling** – Create visual narratives about travel, life events, or daily experiences
- **Artistic projects** – Explore new forms of digital photography and computational art
- **Memory reconstruction** – Build layered visual memories that feel more authentic than single photos
- **Documentary reimagined** – Tell stories about places, people, or experiences in unconventional ways

## 🧠 The Research Behind ngl

This tool emerged from MFA Photography research examining:

- How **computational imaging** on mobile phones creates fundamentally new photographic possibilities
- The role of **AI in artistic production** rather than mere reproduction
- **Algorithmic aesthetics** and surrendering creative control to reveal new perspectives
- **Digital colonialism and gig economy** critique through the lens of technology and labor

The project originally explored the gig economy by documenting work as an app-based delivery worker in Bangalore, using night photography and computational imaging. This evolved into a broader investigation of how AI can help artists "reassemble a fictional world more representative of reality than dull reality itself."
